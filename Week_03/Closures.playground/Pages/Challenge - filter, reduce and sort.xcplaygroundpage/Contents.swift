/*:
 ## Challenge Time ðŸ˜Ž
 
 Create a constant array called `names` which contains some names as strings (any names will do â€” make sure thereâ€™s more than three though!). Now use `reduce` to create a string which is the concatenation of each name in the array.
*/
let names = ["John", "Peter", "Mary", "Theresa", "Bowman"]

//let allNames = names.reduce("", +)
let allNames = names.reduce("") { (result, name) in
    result + " " + name
}
print(allNames)


/*:
 Using the same `names` array, first filter the array to contain only names which have more than four characters in them, and then create the same concatenation of names as in the above exercise. (Hint: you can chain these operations together.)
*/
let longerNames = names.filter { $0.count > 4 }.reduce("") { (result, name) in
    result + " " + name
}

print(longerNames)


/*:
 Create a constant dictionary called `namesAndAges` which contains some names as strings mapped to ages as integers. Now use `filter` to create a dictionary containing only people under the age of 18.
*/
let namesAndAges = ["John": 54, "Peter": 12, "Mary": 18, "Theresa": 35, "Bowman": 42]

let under18 = namesAndAges.filter {
    $0.value < 18
}

print(under18)


/*:
 Using the same `namesAndAges` dictionary, filter out the adults (those 18 or older) and then use `map` to convert to an array containing just the names (i.e. drop the ages).
*/


let adults = namesAndAges.filter {
    $0.value >= 18
}.map {
    nameAndAge in nameAndAge.key
}

print(adults)
